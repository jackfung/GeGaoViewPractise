			"Question": "How much money does World Vision raise every year?",
			"Answer": "Worldwide, World Vision raises about $2 billion annually; the U.S. office, which I head up, raises about half of the total."
			},
			{
			"Question": "Is this the 80/20 rule where twenty percent of the people send in eighty percent of the money or are donations more spread out?",
			"Answer": "World Vision's strength is that we are supported by hundreds of thousands of faithful people who give us about a dollar a day by sponsoring children. Our \"major donors\" account for less than five percent of our total income. Also, for a non-profit, we have quite a diversified portfolio of revenue. Just over forty percent is cash from private citizens; thirty percent is government grants in food and cash; and about thirty percent are products donated from corporation--what we call \"gifts-in-kind.\""
